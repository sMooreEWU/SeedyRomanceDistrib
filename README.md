## üåø My Seedy Romance 

My Seedy Romance is a Farming Dating simulation where your love interest are... a Dragonfruit and a Carrot? Your goal is to collect coins to meet your quota before the date starts! Try to impress your date with how much money you make. Will you win the heart of Alpha Carrotene, the gym bro, or Diyonce, the tsundere fashionista?

## üêõ Known Bugs
1. **Clipping:** We are aware with the clipping issues. We did not find an solution within the time limit, so objects such as trees or rocks may be overlaid.
2. **Shop Prices:** The sheep's price was changed from 30 -> 50. This has not been updated in the UI.
3. **Uncuttable Trees:** Some trees are uncuttable outside of your farm. They are tilemaps and not actual objects. We did not get around to erasing these tilemaps.

## üéÆ Controls
1. **Moving:** WASD (W to move up, A to move left, D to move right, and S to move down).
2. **Inventory:** Pressing 'I' will pull up the inventory.
3. **Selling Items:** Walk up to the chest located near your house and left-click. All items will be sold.
4. **Shops:** Much like selling, walk up to the shop and left-click. Click on "Buy" and the animal will be in your pen (if you have enough gold).
5. **Toolbar:** To select a tool, use the number pad 1, 2 or 3. 
6. **Deforestation:** Left-click on bushes, trees and stones to break them. Each swing is 2 seconds.
